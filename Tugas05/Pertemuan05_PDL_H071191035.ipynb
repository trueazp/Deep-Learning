Second, AlexNet used the ReLU instead of the sigmoid as its activation function. Let us delve into the details below."

Since most images in ImageNet are more than ten times higher and wider than the MNIST images, objects in ImageNet data tend to occupy more pixels. Consequently, a larger convolution window is needed to capture the object. The convolution window shape in the second layer is reduced to **5x5**, followed by **3x3**. In addition, after the first, second, and fifth convolutional layers, the network adds maximum pooling layers with a window shape of **3x3** and a stride of 2. Moreover, AlexNet has ten times more convolution channels than LeNet.\n",

Fortunately, GPU memory is comparatively abundant now, so we rarely need to break up models across GPUs these days (our version of the AlexNet model deviates from the original paper in this aspect)."

        "Besides, AlexNet changed the sigmoid activation function to a simpler ReLU activation function. On one hand, the computation of the ReLU activation function is simpler. For example, it does not have the exponentiation operation found in the sigmoid activation function. On the other hand, the ReLU activation function makes model training easier when using different parameter initialization methods. This is because, when the output of the sigmoid activation function is very close to 0 or 1, the gradient of these regions is almost 0, so that backpropagation cannot continue to update some of the model parameters. In contrast, the gradient of the ReLU activation function in the positive interval is always 1. Therefore, if the model parameters are not properly initialized, the sigmoid function may obtain a gradient of almost 0 in the positive interval, so that the model cannot be effectively trained."

One of the problems with applying AlexNet directly on Fashion-MNIST is that its images have lower resolution (**28x28** pixels) than ImageNet images. To make things work, we upsample them to **224x224** (generally not a smart practice, but we do it here to be faithful to the AlexNet architecture). We perform this resizing with the resize argument in the `d2l.load_data_fashion_mnist` function."

One VGG block consists of a sequence of convolutional layers, followed by a maximum pooling layer for spatial downsampling. In the original VGG paper [Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014], the authors employed convolutions with **3x3** kernels with padding of 1 (keeping height and width) and **2x2** maximum pooling with stride of 2 (halving the resolution after each block). In the code below, we define a function called `vgg_block` to implement one VGG block."

The improvements upon LeNet by AlexNet and VGG mainly lie in how these later networks widen and deepen these two modules. Alternatively, one could imagine using fully-connected layers earlier in the process. However, a careless use of dense layers might give up the spatial structure of the representation entirely, network in network (NiN) blocks offer an alternative."

Also recall that the inputs and outputs of fully-connected layers are typically two-dimensional tensors corresponding to the example and feature. The idea behind NiN is to apply a fully-connected layer at each pixel location (for each height and width). If we tie the weights across each spatial location, we could think of this as a convolutional layer or as a fully-connected layer acting independently on each pixel location. Another way to view this is to think of each element in the spatial dimension (height and width) as equivalent to an example and a channel as equivalent to a feature."

        "In 2014, GoogLeNet won the ImageNet Challenge, proposing a structure that combined the strengths of NiN and paradigms of repeated blocks. One focus of the paper was to address the question of which sized convolution kernels are best. After all, previous popular networks employed choices as small as and as large as . One insight in this paper was that sometimes it can be advantageous to employ a combination of variously-sized kernels. In this section, we will introduce GoogLeNet, presenting a slightly simplified version of the original model: we omit a few ad-hoc features that were added to stabilize training but are unnecessary now with better training algorithms available."

To have a reasonable training time on Fashion-MNIST, we reduce the input height and width from 224 to 96. This simplifies the computation. The changes in the shape of the output between the various modules are demonstrated below."

We then integrate this functionality into a custom layer, whose code mostly addresses bookkeeping matters, such as moving data to the right device context, allocating and initializing any required variables, keeping track of moving averages (here for mean and variance), and so on. This pattern enables a clean separation of mathematics from boilerplate code. Also note that for the sake of convenience we did not worry about automatically inferring the input shape here, thus we need to specify the number of features throughout. Do not worry, the high-level batch normalization APIs in the deep learning framework will care of this for us and we will demonstrate that later."

Each convolutional layer is followed by a batch normalization layer and a ReLU activation function. Then, we skip these two convolution operations and add the input directly before the final ReLU activation function. This kind of design requires that the output of the two convolutional layers has to be of the same shape as the input, so that they can be added together. If we want to change the number of channels, we need to introduce an additional 1x1 convolutional layer to transform the input into the desired shape for the addition operation. Let us have a look at the code below."
